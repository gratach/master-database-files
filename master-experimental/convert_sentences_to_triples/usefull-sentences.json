  "The electron (e\u2212, or \u03b2\u2212 in nuclear reactions) is a subatomic particle with a negative one elementary electric charge.",
  "Like all elementary particles, electrons exhibit properties of both particles and waves: They can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light.",
  "The wave properties of electrons are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a longer de Broglie wavelength for a given energy.",
  "Electrons play an essential role in numerous physical phenomena, such as electricity, magnetism, chemistry, and thermal conductivity; they also participate in gravitational, electromagnetic, and weak interactions.",
  "Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding electric field; if that electron is moving relative to an observer, the observer will observe it to generate a magnetic field.",
  "Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when they are accelerated.",
  "Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as electron plasma by the use of electromagnetic fields.",
  "Special telescopes can detect electron plasma in outer space.",
  "Electrons are involved in many applications, such as tribology or frictional charging, electrolysis, electrochemistry, battery technologies, electronics, welding, cathode-ray tubes, photoelectricity, photovoltaic solar panels, electron microscopes, radiation therapy, lasers, gaseous ionization detectors, and particle accelerators.",
  "The Coulomb force interaction between the positive protons within atomic nuclei and the negative electrons without allows the composition of the two known as atoms.",
  "Ionization or differences in the proportions of negative electrons versus positive nuclei changes the binding energy of an atomic system.",
  "The exchange or sharing of the electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of chemical bonding.",
  "Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney named this charge \"electron\" in 1891, and J. J. Thomson and his team of British physicists identified it as a particle in 1897 during the cathode-ray tube experiment.",
  "Both electric and electricity are derived from the Latin \u0113lectrum (also the root of the alloy of the same name), which came from the Greek word for amber, \u1f24\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (\u0113lektron).",
  "From this and other results of similar types of experiments, du Fay concluded that electricity consists of two electrical fluids, vitreous fluid from glass rubbed with silk and resinous fluid from amber rubbed with wool.",
  "These two fluids can neutralize each other when combined.",
  "American scientist Ebenezer Kinnersley later also independently reached the same conclusion.",
  ":\u200a118\u200a A decade later Benjamin Franklin proposed that electricity was not from different types of electrical fluid, but a single electrical fluid showing an excess (+) or deficit (\u2212).",
  "He gave them the modern charge nomenclature of positive and negative respectively.",
  "Franklin thought of the charge carrier as being positive, but he did not correctly identify which situation was a surplus of the charge carrier, and which situation was a deficit.",
  "Between 1838 and 1851, British natural philosopher Richard Laming developed the idea that an atom is composed of a core of matter surrounded by subatomic particles that had unit electric charges.",
  "Beginning in 1846, German physicist Wilhelm Eduard Weber theorized that electricity was composed of positively and negatively charged fluids, and their interaction was governed by the inverse square law.",
  "After studying the phenomenon of electrolysis in 1874, Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney suggested that there existed a \"single definite quantity of electricity\", the charge of a monovalent ion.",
  "The word electron is a combination of the words electric and ion.",
  "The suffix -on which is now used to designate other subatomic particles, such as a proton or neutron, is in turn derived from electron.",
  "In 1869, Pl\u00fccker's student Johann Wilhelm Hittorf found that a solid body placed in between the cathode and the phosphorescence would cast a shadow upon the phosphorescent region of the tube.",
  "Hittorf inferred that there are straight rays emitted from the cathode and that the phosphorescence was caused by the rays striking the tube walls.",
  "Goldstein dubbed the rays cathode rays.",
  ":\u200a393\u200a Decades of experimental and theoretical research involving cathode rays were important in J. J. Thomson's eventual discovery of electrons.",
  "He then showed in 1874 that the cathode rays can turn a small paddle wheel when placed in their path.",
  "Therefore, he concluded that the rays carried momentum.",
  "Furthermore, by applying a magnetic field, he was able to deflect the rays, thereby demonstrating that the beam behaved as though it were negatively charged.",
  "In 1879, he proposed that these properties could be explained by regarding cathode rays as composed of negatively charged gaseous molecules in a fourth state of matter in which the mean free path of the particles is so long that collisions may be ignored.",
  ":\u200a394\u2013395\u200a\nThe German-born British physicist Arthur Schuster expanded upon Crookes's experiments by placing metal plates parallel to the cathode rays and applying an electric potential between the plates.",
  "The field deflected the rays toward the positively charged plate, providing further evidence that the rays carried negative charge.",
  "By measuring the amount of deflection for a given electric and magnetic field, in 1890 Schuster was able to estimate the charge-to-mass ratio of the ray components.",
  "This is because it was assumed that the charge carriers were much heavier hydrogen or nitrogen atoms.",
  "Schuster's estimates would subsequently turn out to be largely correct.",
  "In 1900, Becquerel showed that the beta rays emitted by radium could be deflected by an electric field, and that their mass-to-charge ratio was the same as for cathode rays.",
  "This evidence strengthened the view that electrons existed as components of atoms.",
  "He further showed that the negatively charged particles produced by radioactive materials, by heated materials and by illuminated materials were universal.",
  ":\u200a273\u200a The term was originally coined by George Johnstone Stoney in 1891 as a tentative name for the basic unit of electrical charge (which had then yet to be discovered).",
  "The electron's charge was more carefully measured by the American physicists Robert Millikan and Harvey Fletcher in their oil-drop experiment of 1909, the results of which were published in 1911.",
  "This experiment used an electric field to prevent a charged droplet of oil from falling as a result of gravity.",
  "This device could measure the electric charge from as few as 1\u2013150 ions with an error margin of less than 0.3%.",
  "Comparable experiments had been done earlier by Thomson's team, using clouds of charged water droplets generated by electrolysis, and in 1911 by Abram Ioffe, who independently obtained the same result as Millikan using charged microparticles of metals, then published his results in 1913.",
  "In 1913, Danish physicist Niels Bohr postulated that electrons resided in quantized energy states, with their energies determined by the angular momentum of the electron's orbit about the nucleus.",
  "The electrons could move between those states, or orbits, by the emission or absorption of photons of specific frequencies.",
  "Chemical bonds between atoms were explained by Gilbert Newton Lewis, who in 1916 proposed that a covalent bond between two atoms is maintained by a pair of electrons shared between them.",
  "In turn, he divided the shells into a number of cells each of which contained one pair of electrons.",
  "With this model Langmuir was able to qualitatively explain the chemical properties of all elements in the periodic table, which were known to largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law.",
  "In 1924, Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli observed that the shell-like structure of the atom could be explained by a set of four parameters that defined every quantum energy state, as long as each state was occupied by no more than a single electron.",
  "This prohibition against more than one electron occupying the same quantum energy state became known as the Pauli exclusion principle.",
  "The physical mechanism to explain the fourth parameter, which had two distinct possible values, was provided by the Dutch physicists Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck.",
  "The intrinsic angular momentum became known as spin, and explained the previously mysterious splitting of spectral lines observed with a high-resolution spectrograph; this phenomenon is known as fine structure splitting.",
  "That is, under the appropriate conditions, electrons and other matter would show properties of either particles or waves.",
  "The corpuscular properties of a particle are demonstrated when it is shown to have a localized position in space along its trajectory at any given moment.",
  "The wave-like nature of light is displayed, for example, when a beam of light is passed through parallel slits thereby creating interference patterns.",
  "Alexander Reid, who was Thomson's graduate student, performed the first experiments but he died soon after in a motorcycle accident and is rarely mentioned.",
  "Rather than yielding a solution that determined the location of an electron over time, this wave equation also could be used to predict the probability of finding an electron near a position, especially a position near where the electron was bound in space, for which the electron wave equations did not change in time.",
  "This approach led to a second formulation of quantum mechanics (the first by Heisenberg in 1925), and solutions of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, like Heisenberg's, provided derivations of the energy states of an electron in a hydrogen atom that were equivalent to those that had been derived first by Bohr in 1913, and that were known to reproduce the hydrogen spectrum.",
  "In order to resolve some problems within his relativistic equation, Dirac developed in 1930 a model of the vacuum as an infinite sea of particles with negative energy, later dubbed the Dirac sea.",
  "In 1947, Willis Lamb, working in collaboration with graduate student Robert Retherford, found that certain quantum states of the hydrogen atom, which should have the same energy, were shifted in relation to each other; the difference came to be called the Lamb shift.",
  "This small difference was later called anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the electron.",
  "This difference was later explained by the theory of quantum electrodynamics, developed by Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, Julian Schwinger and\nRichard Feynman in the late 1940s.",
  "This radiation was caused by the acceleration of electrons through a magnetic field as they moved near the speed of light.",
  "With a beam energy of 1.5 GeV, the first high-energy\nparticle collider was ADONE, which began operations in 1968.",
  "This device accelerated electrons and positrons in opposite directions, effectively doubling the energy of their collision when compared to striking a static target with an electron.",
  "The electron wavefunction spreads in a semiconductor lattice and negligibly interacts with the valence band electrons, so it can be treated in the single particle formalism, by replacing its mass with the effective mass tensor.",
  "Electrons have the lowest mass of any charged lepton (or electrically charged particle of any type) and belong to the first-generation of fundamental particles.",
  "The second and third generation contain charged leptons, the muon and the tau, which are identical to the electron in charge, spin and interactions, but are more massive.",
  "All members of the lepton group are fermions because they all have half-odd integer spin; the electron has spin \u20601/2\u2060.",
  "Due to mass\u2013energy equivalence, this corresponds to a rest energy of 0.511 MeV (8.19\u00d710\u221214 J).",
  "The ratio between the mass of a proton and that of an electron is about 1836.",
  "Electrons have an electric charge of \u22121.602176634\u00d710\u221219 coulombs, which is used as a standard unit of charge for subatomic particles, and is also called the elementary charge.",
  "The electron is commonly symbolized by e\u2212, and the positron is symbolized by e+.",
  "This property is usually stated by referring to the electron as a spin-1/2 particle.",
  "For such particles the spin magnitude is \u2060\u0127/2\u2060, while the result of the measurement of a projection of the spin on any axis can only be \u00b1\u2060\u0127/2\u2060.",
  "In addition to spin, the electron has an intrinsic magnetic moment along its spin axis.",
  "The electron has no known substructure.",
  "In such cases, electrons 'split' into three independent particles, the spinon, the orbiton and the holon (or chargon).",
  "The electron can always be theoretically considered as a bound state of the three, with the spinon carrying the spin of the electron, the orbiton carrying the orbital degree of freedom and the chargon carrying the charge, but in certain conditions they can behave as independent quasiparticles.",
  "The admission of the hypothesis of a finite radius of the electron is incompatible to the premises of the theory of relativity.",
  "On the other hand, a point-like electron (zero radius) generates serious mathematical difficulties due to the self-energy of the electron tending to infinity.",
  "The upper bound of the electron radius of 10\u221218 meters can be derived using the uncertainty relation in energy.",
  "There are elementary particles that spontaneously decay into less massive particles.",
  "An example is the muon, with a mean lifetime of 2.2\u00d710\u22126 seconds, which decays into an electron, a muon neutrino and an electron antineutrino.",
  "The electron, on the other hand, is thought to be stable on theoretical grounds: the electron is the least massive particle with non-zero electric charge, so its decay would violate charge conservation.",
  "This is called the wave\u2013particle duality and can be demonstrated using the double-slit experiment.",
  "In quantum mechanics, the wave-like property of one particle can be described mathematically as a complex-valued function, the wave function, commonly denoted by the Greek letter psi (\u03c8).",
  ":\u200a162\u2013218\u200a\n\nElectrons are identical particles because they cannot be distinguished from each other by their intrinsic physical properties.",
  "The wave function of fermions, including electrons, is antisymmetric, meaning that it changes sign when two electrons are swapped; that is, \u03c8(r1, r2) = \u2212\u03c8(r2, r1), where the variables r1 and r2 correspond to the first and second electrons, respectively.",
  "Since the absolute value is not changed by a sign swap, this corresponds to equal probabilities.",
  "Bosons, such as the photon, have symmetric wave functions instead.",
  ":\u200a162\u2013218\u200a\nIn the case of antisymmetry, solutions of the wave equation for interacting electrons result in a zero probability that each pair will occupy the same location or state.",
  "This principle explains many of the properties of electrons.",
  "For example, it causes groups of bound electrons to occupy different orbitals in an atom, rather than all overlapping each other in the same orbit.",
  ":\u200a162\u2013218\u200a\n\n\n=== Virtual particles ===\n\nIn a simplified picture, which often tends to give the wrong idea but may serve to illustrate some aspects, every photon spends some time as a combination of a virtual electron plus its antiparticle, the virtual positron, which rapidly annihilate each other shortly thereafter.",
  "The combination of the energy variation needed to create these particles, and the time during which they exist, fall under the threshold of detectability expressed by the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, \u0394E \u00b7 \u0394t \u2265 \u0127.",
  "In effect, the energy needed to create these virtual particles, \u0394E, can be \"borrowed\" from the vacuum for a period of time, \u0394t, so that their product is no more than the reduced Planck constant, \u0127 \u2248 6.6\u00d710\u221216 eV\u00b7s.",
  "This causes what is called vacuum polarization.",
  "In effect, the vacuum behaves like a medium having a dielectric permittivity more than unity.",
  "This polarization was confirmed experimentally in 1997 using the Japanese TRISTAN particle accelerator.",
  "Virtual particles cause a comparable shielding effect for the mass of the electron.",
  "The interaction with virtual particles also explains the small (about 0.1%) deviation of the intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron from the Bohr magneton (the anomalous magnetic moment).",
  "The extraordinarily precise agreement of this predicted difference with the experimentally determined value is viewed as one of the great achievements of quantum electrodynamics.",
  "The apparent paradox in classical physics of a point particle electron having intrinsic angular momentum and magnetic moment can be explained by the formation of virtual photons in the electric field generated by the electron.",
  "These photons can heuristically be thought of as causing the electron to shift about in a jittery fashion (known as zitterbewegung), which results in a net circular motion with precession.",
  "This motion produces both the spin and the magnetic moment of the electron.",
  "In atoms, this creation of virtual photons explains the Lamb shift observed in spectral lines.",
  "This wavelength explains the \"static\" of virtual particles around elementary particles at a close distance.",
  "The strength of this force in nonrelativistic approximation is determined by Coulomb's inverse square law.",
  ":\u200a58\u201361\u200a When an electron is in motion, it generates a magnetic field.",
  "This property of induction supplies the magnetic field that drives an electric motor.",
  "The electromagnetic field of an arbitrary moving charged particle is expressed by the Li\u00e9nard\u2013Wiechert potentials, which are valid even when the particle's speed is close to that of light (relativistic).",
  ":\u200a429\u2013434\u200a\n\nWhen an electron is moving through a magnetic field, it is subject to the Lorentz force that acts perpendicularly to the plane defined by the magnetic field and the electron velocity.",
  "This centripetal force causes the electron to follow a helical trajectory through the field at a radius called the gyroradius.",
  "The acceleration from this curving motion induces the electron to radiate energy in the form of synchrotron radiation.",
  ":\u200a160\u200a The energy emission in turn causes a recoil of the electron, known as the Abraham\u2013Lorentz\u2013Dirac Force, which creates a friction that slows the electron.",
  "This force is caused by a back-reaction of the electron's own field upon itself.",
  "Photons mediate electromagnetic interactions between particles in quantum electrodynamics.",
  "An isolated electron at a constant velocity cannot emit or absorb a real photon; doing so would violate conservation of energy and momentum.",
  "Instead, virtual photons can transfer momentum between two charged particles.",
  "The deceleration of the electron results in the emission of Bremsstrahlung radiation.",
  "An inelastic collision between a photon (light) and a solitary (free) electron is called Compton scattering.",
  "This collision results in a transfer of momentum and energy between the particles, which modifies the wavelength of the photon by an amount called the Compton shift.",
  "The maximum magnitude of this wavelength shift is h/mec, which is known as the Compton wavelength.",
  "Such interaction between the light and free electrons is called Thomson scattering or linear Thomson scattering.",
  "This value is a dimensionless quantity formed by the ratio of two energies: the electrostatic energy of attraction (or repulsion) at a separation of one Compton wavelength, and the rest energy of the charge.",
  "It is given by \u03b1 \u2248 0.007297353,\u200d which is approximately equal to \u20601/137\u2060.",
  "If the electron and positron have negligible momentum, a positronium atom can form before annihilation results in two or three gamma ray photons totalling 1.022 MeV.",
  "On the other hand, a high-energy photon can transform into an electron and a positron by a process called pair production, but only in the presence of a nearby charged particle, such as a nucleus.",
  "In the theory of electroweak interaction, the left-handed component of electron's wavefunction forms a weak isospin doublet with the electron neutrino.",
  "This means that during weak interactions, electron neutrinos behave like electrons.",
  "Either member of this doublet can undergo a charged current interaction by emitting or absorbing a W and be converted into the other member.",
  "Both the electron and electron neutrino can undergo a neutral current interaction via a Z0 exchange, and this is responsible for neutrino\u2013electron elastic scattering.",
  "A system of one or more electrons bound to a nucleus is called an atom.",
  "If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus's electrical charge, such an atom is called an ion.",
  "The wave-like behavior of a bound electron is described by a function called an atomic orbital.",
  "Each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy, angular momentum and projection of angular momentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus.",
  "According to the Pauli exclusion principle each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must differ in their spin quantum number.",
  "Electrons can transfer between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy that matches the difference in potential.",
  ":\u200a159\u2013160\u200a Other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles, such as electrons, and the Auger effect.",
  ":\u200a127\u2013132\u200a\nThe orbital angular momentum of electrons is quantized.",
  "Because the electron is charged, it produces an orbital magnetic moment that is proportional to the angular momentum.",
  "The net magnetic moment of an atom is equal to the vector sum of orbital and spin magnetic moments of all electrons and the nucleus.",
  "The magnetic moments of the electrons that occupy the same orbital, called paired electrons, cancel each other out.",
  "The chemical bond between atoms occurs as a result of electromagnetic interactions, as described by the laws of quantum mechanics.",
  "The strongest bonds are formed by the sharing or transfer of electrons between atoms, allowing the formation of molecules.",
  "A fundamental factor in these molecular structures is the existence of electron pairs.",
  "These are electrons with opposed spins, allowing them to occupy the same molecular orbital without violating the Pauli exclusion principle (much like in atoms).",
  "Different molecular orbitals have different spatial distribution of the electron density.",
  "By contrast, in non-bonded pairs electrons are distributed in a large volume around nuclei.",
  "When there is an excess of electrons, the object is said to be negatively charged.",
  "When there are fewer electrons than the number of protons in nuclei, the object is said to be positively charged.",
  "When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, their charges cancel each other and the object is said to be electrically neutral.",
  "A macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing, by the triboelectric effect.",
  "Independent electrons moving in vacuum are termed free electrons.",
  "Electrons in metals also behave as if they were free.",
  "In reality the particles that are commonly termed electrons in metals and other solids are quasi-electrons\u2014quasiparticles, which have the same electrical charge, spin, and magnetic moment as real electrons but might have a different mass.",
  "When free electrons\u2014both in vacuum and metals\u2014move, they produce a net flow of charge called an electric current, which generates a magnetic field.",
  "These interactions are described mathematically by Maxwell's equations.",
  "At a given temperature, each material has an electrical conductivity that determines the value of electric current when an electric potential is applied.",
  "In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator.",
  "Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation.",
  "On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands.",
  "The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave as if they were free or delocalized electrons.",
  "These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, they are free to move like a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.",
  "Because of collisions between electrons and atoms, the drift velocity of electrons in a conductor is on the order of millimeters per second.",
  "However, the speed at which a change of current at one point in the material causes changes in currents in other parts of the material, the velocity of propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed.",
  "This occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave, with the velocity dependent on the dielectric constant of the material.",
  "Metals make relatively good conductors of heat, primarily because the delocalized electrons are free to transport thermal energy between atoms.",
  "However, unlike electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature.",
  "This is expressed mathematically by the Wiedemann\u2013Franz law, which states that the ratio of thermal conductivity to the electrical conductivity is proportional to the temperature.",
  "When cooled below a point called the critical temperature, materials can undergo a phase transition in which they lose all resistivity to electric current, in a process known as superconductivity.",
  "In BCS theory, pairs of electrons called Cooper pairs have their motion coupled to nearby matter via lattice vibrations called phonons, thereby avoiding the collisions with atoms that normally create electrical resistance.",
  "Electrons inside conducting solids, which are quasi-particles themselves, when tightly confined at temperatures close to absolute zero, behave as though they had split into three other quasiparticles: spinons, orbitons and holons.",
  "=== Motion and energy ===\nAccording to Einstein's theory of special relativity, as an electron's speed approaches the speed of light, from an observer's point of view its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it more and more difficult to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference.",
  "Since an electron behaves as a wave, at a given velocity it has a characteristic de Broglie wavelength.",
  "This is given by \u03bbe = h/p where h is the Planck constant and p is the momentum.",
  "For the 51 GeV electron above, the wavelength is about 2.4\u00d710\u221217 m, small enough to explore structures well below the size of an atomic nucleus.",
  "For reasons that remain uncertain, during the annihilation process there was an excess in the number of particles over antiparticles.",
  "Hence, about one electron for every billion electron\u2013positron pairs survived.",
  "This excess matched the excess of protons over antiprotons, in a condition known as baryon asymmetry, resulting in a net charge of zero for the universe.",
  "The surviving protons and neutrons began to participate in reactions with each other\u2014in the process known as nucleosynthesis, forming isotopes of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of lithium.",
  "This process peaked after about five minutes.",
  "What followed is a period known as recombination, when neutral atoms were formed and the expanding universe became transparent to radiation.",
  "These antimatter particles immediately annihilate with electrons, releasing gamma rays.",
  "However, the process of stellar evolution can result in the synthesis of radioactive isotopes.",
  "Selected isotopes can subsequently undergo negative beta decay, emitting an electron and antineutrino from the nucleus.",
  "In exchange, the other member of the pair is given negative energy, which results in a net loss of mass\u2013energy by the black hole.",
  "The rate of Hawking radiation increases with decreasing mass, eventually causing the black hole to evaporate away until, finally, it explodes.",

  "For example, in high-energy environments such as the corona of a star, free electrons form a plasma that radiates energy due to Bremsstrahlung radiation.",
  "Electron gas can undergo plasma oscillation, which is waves caused by synchronized variations in electron density, and these produce energy emissions that can be detected by using radio telescopes.",
  "The frequency of a photon is proportional to its energy.",
  "As a bound electron transitions between different energy levels of an atom, it absorbs or emits photons at characteristic frequencies.",
  "For instance, when atoms are irradiated by a source with a broad spectrum, distinct dark lines appear in the spectrum of transmitted radiation in places where the corresponding frequency is absorbed by the atom's electrons.",
  "When detected, spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of these lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.",

  "The distribution of the electrons in solid materials can be visualized by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).",
  "This technique employs the photoelectric effect to measure the reciprocal space\u2014a mathematical representation of periodic structures that is used to infer the original structure.",
  "They allow energy densities up to 107 W\u00b7cm\u22122 across a narrow focus diameter of 0.1\u20131.3 mm and usually require no filler material.",
  "This welding technique must be performed in a vacuum to prevent the electrons from interacting with the gas before reaching their target, and it can be used to join conductive materials that would otherwise be considered unsuitable for welding.",
  "Electron-beam lithography (EBL) is a method of etching semiconductors at resolutions smaller than a micrometer.",
  "This technique is limited by high costs, slow performance, the need to operate the beam in the vacuum and the tendency of the electrons to scatter in solids.",
  "The last problem limits the resolution to about 10 nm.",
  "For this reason, EBL is primarily used for the production of small numbers of specialized integrated circuits.",
  "Electron beam processing is used to irradiate materials in order to change their physical properties or sterilize medical and food products.",
  "intensive electron radiation causes a many orders of magnitude decrease of viscosity and stepwise decrease of its activation energy.",
  "Linear particle accelerators generate electron beams for treatment of superficial tumors in radiation therapy.",
  "Electron therapy can treat such skin lesions as basal-cell carcinomas because an electron beam only penetrates to a limited depth before being absorbed, typically up to 5 cm for electron energies in the range 5\u201320 MeV.",
  "These particles emit synchrotron radiation as they pass through magnetic fields.",
  "The dependency of the intensity of this radiation upon spin polarizes the electron beam\u2014a process known as the Sokolov\u2013Ternov effect.",
  "Electron and positron beams are collided upon the particles' accelerating to the required energies; particle detectors observe the resulting energy emissions, which particle physics studies.",
